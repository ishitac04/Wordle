# Wordle
In this game, you will have six guesses to guess a five-letter word. If a letter is correct, but in the wrong place, it is underlined. If it is correct in the right place, it will become bold. Your list of unguessed letters will appear at the start of each guess to help you make your guess. Careful though, you only get six :)
